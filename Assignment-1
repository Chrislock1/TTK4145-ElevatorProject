Task 3
1)
  Q:  What is concurrency? What is parallelism? What's the difference?
  A:  Concurrency is when multiple computationsare executed simultaneously, and might interact with each other. 
        A concurrent system may either run on the same core (they divide the processor time into parts and share it between them.
        Therefore a new computation may begin before another stops.
      Parallelism is a branch of concurrency in which the concurrent processes are didived amongst the cores in a processor. In 
        this setting the different computastions are happening exactly simultaneously.
        
  Q:  What kinds of problems motivates the need for concurrent execution? (Or phrased differently: What problems do concurrency help
        in solving?)
  A:  There are a number of benefits with concurrent execution. Some problems might be best suited for the divide and concquer
      -strategy. Here the need for concurrent execution is obvious. Another example is any operating system, where you want to 
      interface with the system concurrently as the system execute subroutines and perform other executions (like playing music,
      maintaining a video-feed, keeping track of the mouse, installing updates ect..)
      
  Q:  Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both? (Come back to this after you have
      worked on part 4 of this exercise)
  A:    
  
  Q:  What are the differences between processes, threads, green threads, and coroutines?
  A:  - A process is a instance of a computer program, containing the programs source code. It may be made up of several threads.
      - A thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed by a scheduler. A process may consist of
      several threads being executed concurrently or in order. 
      - A green thread is a thread being executed in the user space, in a virtual machine. This is a way to run multithread
      programs on operating systems that doesn't support it. 
      - Coroutines are components of a computer program that voluntarily release control to allow other routines to be run, and 
      act as a form of multithreading where the scheduler is simplified to just start programs and give control to programs when 
      requested.
  
  Q:  Which one of these do pthread_create() (C/POSIX), threading.Thread() (Python), go (Go) create?
  A:  This obviously create a thread.
  
  Q:  How does pythons Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) influence the way a python Thread behaves?
  A:  It acts as a bottle neck as it
